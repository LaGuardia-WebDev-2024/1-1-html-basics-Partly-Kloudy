  <h1>
    It Lingers
  </h1>
 <p>
On a cold, dark, misty kind of day, <br>
As a ray of sun shines through,<br>
Hope, it lingers in the air,<br>
Like the smell of morning rain.<br>
  </p>
Love, it lingers in my heart,<br>
As I see you in my dreams!<br>
We would never fall apart,<br>
This is love to me it seems!<br>
<p>
   
<p>
  On a warm summer morning,<br>
The sky is clear.<br>
The sun is shining,<br>
As I hold you near.<br>
  </p>
  
  <p>
I’ll walk across a river<br>
To get to you.<br>
Grab my hand!<br>
We’ll make it through.<br>
  </p>
  
  <p>
I imagine sun,<br>
I imagine love,<br>
I’m calling out to you.<br>
  </p>
    
  <p>
I live in my dreams<br>
Falling apart at the seams<br>
I imagine someone!<br>
  </p>

Lonely walking through the street,<br>
I will think of you some days.<br>

You linger in my mind,<br>
Yes I know this isn’t real.<br>
  </p>
