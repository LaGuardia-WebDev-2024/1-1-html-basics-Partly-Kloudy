    <h1>It Lingers</h1>

      On a cold, dark, misty kind of day, <br />
      As a ray of sun shines through,<br />
      <em>Hope</em>, it lingers in the air,<br />
      Like the smell of morning rain.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Love</em>, it lingers in my heart,<br />
      As I see you in my dreams!<br />
      We would <em>never</em> fall apart,<br />
      <strong>This is love to me it seems!</strong><br />
    </p>

    <p>
      On a warm summer morning,<br />
      The sky is <em>clear</em>.<br />
      The sun is <em>shining</em>,<br />
      As I hold you near.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ll walk across a river<br />
      To get to <em>you</em>.<br />
      Grab my hand!<br />
      <em>We’ll make it through</em>.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      I imagine <strong>sun</strong>,<br />
      I imagine <strong>love</strong>,<br />
      I’m calling out to you.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      I live in my dreams<br />
      Falling apart at the seams<br />
      <strong>I imagine someone!</strong><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Lonely walking through the street,<br />
      I will think of you some days.<br />
    </p>

    <em>You linger in my mind</em>,<br />
    Yes I know this isn’t real.<br />

    <p>
      <strong><em>Yes I know this isn't real</em></strong
      >.<br />
